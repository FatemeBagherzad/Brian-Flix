# BrainFlix Project

In this project I practiced chunking an existing
site into React components and converting an
existing static site into a React app.
Also I used and practiced **useState** to add a
state variable to all components.

📢I rebuild whole control bar of video by myself
using react **useState** 🎉<br/> -
**Update1**: I have fixed video control reload with useEffect🥳<br/> -
**Update2**: I have tried editing, deleting and posting comments on every video which I hope I can Improve it in future😊<br/> -

**Update3**: I created back end for this project using: express, cors, multer,morgan, dotenv, uniqid and nodemon. Uploading image to back end was challenging that I could solve it. -
