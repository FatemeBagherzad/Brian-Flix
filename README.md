# BrainFlix Project

In this project, I converted an existing static website into a React application by breaking the UI into reusable components and managing component behavior with React hooks.

One of the main parts of the project was **rebuilding the video control bar entirely from scratch**. I implemented custom playback controls, progress tracking, and user interactions without relying on the browser’s default video controls.

As the project evolved, I added a backend using Node.js and Express to support additional functionality. This included handling image uploads, managing data, and logging requests. Implementing file uploads on the server side was a challenge, but I was able to solve it and integrate it smoothly.

## Highlights

<li>Refactored a static site into a component-based React app</li>
<li>Built a fully custom video control bar</li>
<li>Fixed video reload issues using useEffect</li>
<li>Implemented comment creation, editing, and deletion</li>
<li>Developed a backend with Express, CORS, Multer, Morgan, dotenv, uniqid, and Nodemon</li>
